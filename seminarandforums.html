            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">First of all, I will define what is mission planning, it is a sort of briefing conducted before a mission will commence and follows a certain pattern which allows everyone to know what the mission is all about. It should be clear, measurable, achievable and aligned to what is the main goal would be. In mission planning before setting the mission objective, understanding how high-performing teams come together on the road to Flawless Execution is a critical portion of tackling failure rates and planning for success. So as a future public safety officer who will lead men out on the grounds it is important for me to identify or set the objective of the mission. Next is for me to evaluate the possible threats. A vital undertaking prior to developing action is ensuring the team has an appropriate level of concern for the potential threats to project completion or barriers to flawless execution. This is done by identifying obstacles and classifying them. Then we need to identify our closest resources because evaluating the resources available or required for the team that will lead to success. If more resources are needed to support flawless execution whether brain power, funds, or equipment this is the time to identify the need. Ideally, at least one resource will be allocated for each identified threat. Next for me is to identify what would be the possible lessons learned. There is an obvious benefit to learning from the mistakes and successes of prior missions, which is why the collection, analysis, and dissemination of Lessons Learned is so important. By focusing on Lessons Learned, your organization can foster a culture of continued learning and accelerated performance, thereby iteratively improving through each business cycle. Then prior to last step is to plan the course of action, this is often where the best ideas come to light; gather these ideas, formulate them into individually accountable, actionable items with a specific completion expectation. This step is the core of mission planning where the action in execution originates. What is important to stress is that each person is in charge of his or her particular task and must meet the team deadlines in order to achieve flawless execution. Accountability, therefore, becomes an important byproduct of the strategic planning process as well as project success everyone will strive to meet goals, while pushing hard for success, driving personal improvement, and ultimately, flawless execution. Lastly, is the contingency plan because having contingency plan to refer to is a must, and without one, your team is left scrambling when contingencies arise and they inevitably will. Prepare for an off-schedule problems beforehand and the possibility of a contingency occurring becomes less consequential. And these were my insights about my role on mission planning are all about.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">The lecturer gives us a lecture on the significance of the global digital age. Index crimes include offenses against persons like murder, homicide, assault, and rape as well as offenses against things such robbery, theft, kidnapping, and livestock rustling, according to the Philippine National Police (PNP).</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">The Index is based on the number of crimes per 1,000 persons that are committed in a given city or region. A neighborhood is safer than 80% of American communities if it has a crime index of 80, and it is safer than 50% of American communities if it has a crime index of 50.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Let me ask you first: What is the meaning of crime? Any unlawful behavior for which you must be proven guilty in order to receive punishment is considered a crime. Additionally, it might be considered criminal behavior, a serious offense, particularly when morality is at stake. Crime affects everyone, regardless of who they are. Criminals can be found in all sexes, races, and ethnicities.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">The speaker distinguishes between crimes on and off the index. Index crimes, also known as "Part I" crimes, are defined by their gravity and frequency of occurrence. These crimes include murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, human trafficking, and arson. Index crimes are often divided into two groups: violent and property crimes. While offenses against women and children, violations of special laws involving reckless imprudence resulting in property damage or bodily harm, illegal possession of firearms and drugs, illegal logging, lasciviousness, direct assault, and other offenses not listed under index crimes are non-index crimes.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">The term "vehicular event" or "vehicular accident" also refers to truck accidents, motorcycle accidents, and car accidents. In the majority of rated increasing situations, an accident victim has a legal right to demand compensation from anyone who was at fault, regardless of the type of motor vehicle involved.</p>

            </header>
            
            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">The speaker gives us a presentation on the significance of decision-making for future public servants who will manage individuals and the community as well. I've learned from this afternoon's lecture that making a decision, gathering information, and weighing alternative courses of action are all parts of the decision-making process. By gathering relevant data and articulating your options in a step-by-step manner, you may make more thoughtful, knowledgeable decisions.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">A major issue with police operations is decision-making. In the world of law enforcement, we have a limited amount of time to make critical decisions that could mean the difference between life and death. Criminal justice leadership may respond more logically and strategically while under duress due to training, conditioning, and practice, even though there is no foolproof strategy for making judgments.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">When faced with stressful conditions, which are defined as being unexpected, unstable, chaotic, and under high stress, police officers lose their ability to make logical, reasonable decisions. Psychological traps can also have a negative impact on the decision-making abilities of police leaders. </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Why is decision-making vital, then? Because it entails more than just understanding principles and applying them to certain situations. In the real world, decisions about potential courses of action are made using discretion, or the individual use of judgment. In order to make an informed and logical decision as leaders after we graduate from this famous university, which may be months from now, and take over our designated police station, we'll need to have solid decision-making abilities. Because a person with these talents can weigh all the evidence, comprehend the company's goals and current situation, and select the best course of action.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">What PGEN Cascolan discussed in the session astounded me. He taught us the value of the organization's Enhanced Managing Police Operation (EMPO). The EMPO broadened the definition of "anti-criminality" to encompass routine law enforcement activities, such as police presence and targeted law enforcement operations, crime investigation and solution, security measures, such as target hardening, border control, social investigation, community partnership, and appropriate resource deployment, and public affairs, such as using the quad media to advance public awareness and communication.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">As is common knowledge, the police are in charge of maintaining law and order, safeguarding the public, and preventing, identifying, and inquiring into unlawful conduct. Policing is the term used to describe these actions. Police frequently take on a number of licensing and regulating responsibilities.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Future police officers must understand the significance of the group to its members and its distinctive characteristics, such as its high level of togetherness. Effective police leadership increases the likelihood that officers will identify with both the group and the leader, generating a sense of community that enhances police performance.</p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">By incorporating moral ideals into an organization's processes, ethical leadership improves organizational performance. The development of the proper ideas, beliefs, and values has a significant impact on an individual's behavior at work, conduct, and deeds (Rabie and Abdul Malek, 2020).</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">When someone leads ethically, they operate in accordance with a set of values and principles that are universally acknowledged as creating a strong basis for the general good, according to our speaker, PBGEN Sosito. Among these include integrity, respect, trust, fairness, transparency, and honesty. Ethics-driven leadership must be carefully chosen. By encouraging a sense of reliability, ethical leadership enables followers to embrace and adhere to our goal with a high level of integrity.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">When leaders behave justly and decently, team members have less reasons to depart. A culture of trust and respect is encouraged, fostered, and promoted by ethical leaders to create the best environment for their team. This has a lot of benefits, such as lower turnover, higher production, and enhanced loyalty.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">As aspiring public servants, we ought to be concerned about the welfare and health of our staff members as well as their safety on the job. We assist them in creating an environment that is supportive of each individual, the team, and the entire organization. As moral leaders, we ensure that everyone in the organization behaves morally. Our character and integrity serve as a strong foundation for other personal attributes and serve to direct our ethical thoughts, attitudes, and decisions.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">Mr. Sevilla, the AGRIPORTAL seminar's speaker, made two visits to the academy to discuss the essential of food security in law enforcement. He stresses the need of having sustainable agriculture on where we work.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">One of the biggest issues the world is now facing is food security. It is true that there is enough food for everyone in the globe, but because of the significant changes that occurred quickly in the world, the price of food has decreased and access to it has become more challenging. In order for everyone to eat enough and for families to create their communities without having to worry about their own safety, food security is crucial. In the coming years, food supply must treble to satisfy demand, addressing various problems including famine, malnutrition, and the resulting health problems.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">In addition to supporting the goals of governance, such as increased civic engagement and effective rule of law, stable and efficient agricultural systems and people with access to food may do so. As future public officer, conflict is sparked by a lack of access to food. The rise in global temperatures, which has led to widespread crop failures and a movement of people, is directly responsible for the increase in hunger. Global food networks mean that crop failures in one region of the world can have devastating effects on the peace and stability of a whole continent. Therefore, if this keeps happening and there isn't enough food available where we work, my staff or subordinates will get hungry and won't be able to do their jobs effectively.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">Human trafficking is among the most horrific crimes ever committed, especially
                when minors are involved. 25 million people are employed as slaves worldwide each year. Victims are used for the benefit of their captors in an industry that earns an average of $150 billion annually and is continually growing.
                </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">It occurs in almost every sector of the economy, including domestic work, manufacturing, mining, fishing, and commercial sex. Human trafficking is defined as "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of people through force, fraud, or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit." Additionally, victims of human trafficking could experience forced marriage and combat. In truth, victims are slaves even if they receive recompense, which they occasionally do not. Traffickers frequently use the promise of quick money to entice young men and women from outlying areas here in the Philippines. Then, they are made available for sex purchase at bars, pubs, nightclubs, karaoke rooms, on the streets, or on social media.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Human trafficking is caused by a variety of factors, including poverty, a lack of education, the demand for cheap labor and sex, a lack of protection for human rights, a lack of legitimate economic opportunities, cultural considerations, conflict and natural disasters, a lack of safe migration options, deceit and intimidation, and financial gain.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">We should at least step up efforts to discover and assist victims of child labor trafficking as future public enforcers in order to prevent human trafficking. Government financing for initiatives that help trafficking victims reintegrate, like access to job training and local jobs, should be increased. By expanding the number of victim-witness coordinators who collaborate with anti-trafficking task groups, human trafficking can be prevented.</p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">I feel privileged to be present for a well-known speaker like Mr. Erich Meier Junior's speech this afternoon. I believe that human rights laws and international humanitarian law are complementary. They both work to protect human dignity, albeit in different contexts and with different approaches.
                </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">All human rights laws are applicable at all times and in all circumstances, and they cover everyone who is under the authority of a State. Its goal is to protect the populace from the State's arbitrary actions. Therefore, even in times of armed conflict, human rights laws remain in effect. However, in times of "public emergency which threatens the existence of the nation," of which armed conflict is without a doubt an example, human rights conventions like the American Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permit derogations from some rights under strict conditions. To put it another way, some rights (such as the freedom of movement, liberty, and security, as well as social freedom, etc.) may be suspended or limited solely to the "strictly necessary extent" requirements of the public emergency (both geographically and temporarily), but there is still a "core" set of rights that can never be suspended, under any circumstances..</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">There are many instances of international and human rights laws being broken today. The victims of battle are civilians more and more often. There are important exceptions, though. where the protection of citizens, prisoners, the sick, the injured, and the restriction of the use of cruel weapons have all benefited from the application of humanitarian international law. It will always be difficult to put this body of law into practice because it applies in times of intense violence. Despite this, there is still an urgent need for effective compliance.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">It's crucial to understand that IHL protects those who are not or are no longer involved in hostilities and limits the tools and techniques of war.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">The National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), the primary intelligence gathering and analysis agency of the Philippine government, is in charge of carrying out overt, covert, and clandestine intelligence activities. The NICA works with friendly nations and governmental groups both inside and outside of the country by designating operatives as liaison officers.
                </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">All intelligence agencies' primary duty is to provide governments with accurate information about potential threats to the nation and its people. The goal of intelligence services is to unravel complex issues and highlight brand-new dangers, opportunities, and concerns that could have an impact on national security</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">As a result, it provides guidance and support to aid commanders in making decisions. In order to achieve this purpose, information from a range of sources is evaluated and the results are customized to the commanders' mission objectives. Alternatively, questions that arise during operational or campaign planning can be addressed. In order to provide an analysis, the commander's information needs must first be identified. These needs are then taken into account during the gathering, analyzing, and dissemination of intelligence.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">I've learned that gathering intelligence is essential to the current conflict since it informs us of probable adversary activities and future intentions. Information may contain things like the arsenals of the opposition, the size of their forces, the patterns of their movement, and future operations schedules, to name a few.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Therefore, intelligence is crucial because it encourages the reduction of crime and harm, disruption, and prevention through strategic and tactical management, deployment, and enforcement.</p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">All sides must coordinate their movements if the conflict is to be won. The fourth dimension of the battlefield and time are clearly in focus thanks to integration and coordination. A tactically sound strategy that directs activity is necessary for effective battle.
                </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">I have discovered that it provides direction and a framework for strategic planning when the firm must adjust to rising demands. Focusing on the organization's mission can help it adhere to its core objective while also serving as a guide for decisions in challenging circumstances.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">I may be responsible for deciding how to make decisions and what actions to take in each situation as a future law enforcement officer and soon-to-be commander of a station. A thorough depiction of my mental picture of the battlefield is necessary for the planning process. I'll be responsible for planning, directing, and spending time outside. Throughout the entire process, the commander's input is essential because it gives the staff focus and direction. The time I have, my preferences, the knowledge and accessibility of the subordinates, as well as his personal preferences, all affect how much direct involvement I have. The commander's engagement is frequently higher the less time they have available, the less experienced they are, and the less accessible they are.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">I am responsible for carrying out the duties in a fair and impartial manner as the commanding officer. Since I understand that he is only human, a successful commanding officer would communicate his goals, aspirations, and standards in writing to his command as soon as he assumes responsibility. In order to keep himself on the straight and true path, he will also ask his support group for guidance.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">More specifically, commanders employ the operational process with the aid of their staffs to comprehend, picture, and define their operational environment, goal, and operational strategy; to make and articulate decisions; and to command, direct, and assess military actions.</p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">I consider it a privilege and an honor to have our director, PMGEN Eric E. Noble, speak at this afternoon's lecture. Police Community Affairs and Development develops institutional frameworks to enhance better police-community interactions and to foster networking with local, national, and international non-governmental groups. Our director talked to us about a few techniques he's picked up from working in the field of Police Community Affairs and Development.
                </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">I've discovered that police community relations is the most significant development in police organization because it emphasizes the necessity of cooperating as a community to fight crime and deter potential criminal behavior. Police community relations add problem-solving and preventative oriented techniques to traditional crime fighting. Additionally, I've discovered that having single phone lines for all important departments and installing command-and-control systems for metropolitan agencies can all help to cut reaction times.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">For the police to gain the people's trust as future public servants, good police-community interactions are crucial. Without this trust, police work is far less successful. Even if police are successful in deterring crime, people could not feel safe because of the low level of confidence.</p>
