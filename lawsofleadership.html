<div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-64 w3-container" style="font-size: 25px;">
    <div class="w3-content">
      <div class="">

        <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book "The 21 Irrefutable Law of Leadership" was written by John C. Maxwell. This timeless and empowering book shows you that leadership is learned not inherited and that you can become a leader too, if you internalize some of the universal principles at play in any leader-follower-relationship.</p>
            
        <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I like about this book is that it talks about how a leader must always stand on solid ground and stick to the rules you represent. The number one element that empowers a leader to be successful is "trust". Even a CEO needs his employees to trust him, because otherwise, why would they bother working with him for a risky business venture for a long time? According to Maxwell, trust is built mainly on three things: honesty, fairness and good judgement. When leaders think they’re above the rules, trouble follows – take Richard Nixon, for example, who thought legal rules wouldn’t apply to him and deemed an illegal break-in as an okay thing to set up. That is only one of the many great points you can get from this amazing book.</p>

        <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a must-read and it’s important to note John Maxwell’s 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership isn’t a set of rules or guidelines for being a leader. What Maxwell means by “irrefutable laws” is that these laws remain true, whether or not you practice them. The bottom-line in leadership isn't how far we advance ourselves but how far we advance others. </p>
        <!-- <br>
        
        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>2. The Law of Influence</b></p>
            
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Leadership is influence—nothing more, nothing less.”</p>

        <p class="w3-text-black">Would your employees follow you if they didn’t have to? With this law, Maxwell says real leaders develop followers, not because of their title but because they positively influence others’ lives, making people want to follow them.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black"></p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>3. The Law of Process </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Becoming a leader is a lot like investing successfully in the stock market. If your hope is to make a fortune in a day, you’re not going to be successful.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">In this law, Maxwell refers to Anne Schieber, who gifted 22 million to Yeshiva University, despite only making $3,150 a year. She did this by developing a process where she picked stocks listed in the newspaper each day and reinvested the money she made back into the market. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell uses her example to demonstrate how important good habits and daily processes are for accruing compound interest in leadership abilities. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>4. The Law of Navigation </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“A leader is one who sees more than others see, who sees farther than others see, and who sees before others do.”
            LEROY EIMS
            </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">People follow leaders due to their confidence, positivity, and ability to communicate a greater portrait of the future. Additionally, they give followers purpose by letting them know how they can change the world for the better. Then, they call them to do so. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>5. The Law of Addition </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“When you try to be top dog, you don’t create loyalty. If you can’t give credit (and take blame), you will drown in your inability to inspire.”
            JIM SINEGAL
            </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Being a great leader means adding value to others’ lives by serving them. Maxwell uses Jim Sinegal, the co-founder and former CEO of Costco, as an example. During his time, he walked humbly alongside his employees. Sinegal wore the same name tags they did, visited each store once a year, and took meetings with anyone who requested one.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Although he didn’t have to, he raised employees’ wages to 42 percent above other rivals. He also slashed healthcare costs and provided benefits in an industry where they were normally excluded. Because of his leadership and belief in the Law of Addition, Costco had the lowest employee turnover of any retail store.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">As Sinegal demonstrates, the function of leadership isn’t about being in charge or having authority over others.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>6. The Law of Solid Ground </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“To build trust, a leader must exhibit competence, connection, and character.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">In The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, Maxwell says trust is the most crucial aspect of leadership. It is the foundation which all relationships are built upon. When you continuously break a person’s trust, your relationship with them will dissolve. Organizations that lack trust in leadership are full of dissent, unrest, and high turnover. However, companies with high levels of trust can drive impact and change the world for the better. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>7. The Law of Respect </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“One measure of leadership is the caliber of people who choose to follow you.”
            DENNIS A. PEER
            </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell says when it comes to leadership, there is a natural order. For example, if you threw a group of ten random professionals together, a pecking order would emerge. The best leader would be at the top (CEO). Below them, two good managers would fall below this person (COO and president). Another tier of people might develop under these executives (directors and managers), while a larger group of entry-level employees would follow them. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>8. The Law of Intuition </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“A leader has to read the situation and know instinctively what play to call.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">One of the indispensable qualities all great leaders have is the intuition to make the right decisions. They do this through the gift of foresight, or the ability to think about how certain actions will affect the future. Other factors in decision-making include being aware of their environment, asking good questions, and being flexible in their behavior and thinking.  </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell points to Steve Jobs’ decision to ask Bill Gates to collaborate with him, despite a tense legal battle between Microsoft and Apple. Jobs inherited the mess caused by previous leaders, but still needed to find a solution. He read the situation, used his intuition, and made a firm choice to call Gates. The result of the call ended in a 150 million dollar investment in Apple and a 33 percent raise in the business’s stock value. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>9. The Law of Magnetism </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Who you are is not determined by what you want. It’s determined by who you are.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Take a look at your employees, friends, and business associates. Are they high-quality people with huge dreams they’re actively accomplishing, or are they low-quality people who struggle with self-motivation, discipline, and follow through? </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">The Law of Magnetism says who you surround yourself with is a mirror to who you are. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>10. The Law of Connection</b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“The stronger the relationship and connection between individuals, the more likely the follower will want to help the leader.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Out of all the 21 laws of leadership, the Law of Connection is one of the most important. Followers won’t move into action if they don’t feel emotionally connected to their leader. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell uses Frederick Douglass as an example. As a great leader and orator, he could make audiences feel (or vividly imagine) what it was like to be enslaved, which drove people to become abolitionists. Without this type of connection, people wouldn’t have become enraged enough to want to end American slavery. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>11. The Law of the Inner Circle </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“A leader’s potential is determined by the people closest to him.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">It is said you become the sum of the five people you spend the most time with. While most people don’t carefully select people to build relationships with, leaders do. It’s a part of their strategy to step into their full potential.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>12. The Law of Empowerment </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Leading well is not about enriching yourself—it’s about empowering others.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Another one of the most critical 21 laws of leadership to understand is the Law of Empowerment. Basically, it states leaders must find great leaders, grow them into even better leaders, provide them with any resources or authority they need to succeed, and get out of the way so they can do their jobs. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Those who empower rather than control gain respect, trust, and admiration from their followers. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>13. The Law of the Picture </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Followers may doubt what their leaders say, but they usually believe what they do.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">In The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, one of the common themes of a leader versus a follower is that leaders continuously communicate a goal of a better future. They also outline their mission, or why followers should get involved. Finally, they are the ones who give people a strategy or a plan of action to achieve the vision. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>14. The Law of Buy-In </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“As a leader, your success is measured by your ability to actually take the people where they need to go. But you can do that only if the people first buy into you.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Vision, while important, isn’t what creates buy-in. Who you are as a leader does. You must show people who you are and where you can take them before they want to follow you. Vision and great leadership must work hand in hand. Otherwise, followers will either find another leader or get another vision. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>15. The Law of Victory </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Victorious leaders possess an unwillingness to accept defeat. The alternative to winning is totally unacceptable to them.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Think of leaders like Winston Churchill or Michael Jordan. Despite facing an almost certain defeat in World War II, Churchill refused to accept this outcome. Michael Jordan, even when put on a scrimmage team full of B players, still ended up winning. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">People with the most success have tenacity and passion, which is why they are winners. They’ll do whatever it takes not to lose.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>16. The Law of the Big Mo</b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“You cannot kindle a fire in any other heart until it is burning within your own.”
            ELEANOR DOAN
            </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Small wins create momentum toward achieving larger goals. Take a football game, for example. Rushing 20 yards in one play gets the team excited to get the touchdown they need. Players’ adrenaline starts pumping, their confidence increases, and they feel like they can tackle any challenges. Multiple successful plays like this are what wins games, and ultimately championships. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Multiple small losses have the reverse effect. It causes people to feel discouraged, sad, and insecure. The team starts to question if they have what it takes to achieve their big goals. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">It’s a leader’s job to generate momentum and keep it flowing. This is done by evaluating what’s working, what needs to change, and what opportunities to capitalize on. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>17. The Law of Priorities </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“A leader is the one who climbs the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells, ‘Wrong jungle!’”
            STEPHEN COVEY
            </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Leaders know that busyness doesn’t lead to accomplishment: setting top priorities does. In this chapter of The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, Maxwell uses famed basketball coach John Wooden as an example. Each practice was strategically planned by the minute to move the team in the right direction. This type of hyperfocus on making the team’s work count won 10 NCAA championships and resulted in four undefeated seasons. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>18. The Law of Sacrifice </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell says in The 21 Laws of Irrefutable Leadership, too often, people glamourize the life of being a leader. They think being a top executive provides power, glory, and riches. However the author says, “A leader must give up to go up.” </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">He uses Martin Luther King, Jr., as an example. King was aware of the dangers of leading the Civil Rights Movement. Though he was beaten and imprisoned on multiple occasions, this was the sacrifice he chose to make to see his dream of a better future </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">through. He could’ve backed out at any time, but he was willing to die for his cause and help transform the world. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell says the greater your vision and mission, the greater sacrifices you must make. In short, your rights decrease as your responsibilities increase. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">•	p skills over time. </p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>19. The Law of Timing </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“When the right leader and the right timing come together, incredible things happen.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">As the adage goes, “Timing is everything.” Maxwell says when a leader acts, there are only four results. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">•	Wrong action + wrong time = disaster</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">•	Right action + wrong time = resistance from your team</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">•	Wrong action + right time = mistake</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">•	Right action + right time = success</p>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>20. The Law of Explosive Growth </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“Leadership development compounds. The more you invest in people and the longer you do it, the greater the growth and the higher the return.”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">Maxwell says the key to experiencing massive growth is not leading followers but leading other leaders. Great leadership has an infinite reach because once you’re a leader, your job is to multiply more leaders who keep the cycle going. This is how your influence spreads and starts to generate real momentum and impact.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="w3-text-black"><b>21. The Law of Legacy </b></p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">“My life sentence is, ‘I want to add value to leaders who will multiply value to others.’”</p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">The final chapter of The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership touches on creating a legacy. Maxwell asks readers what they want people to say about them at their funeral. This will help the wheels start spinning when developing a clear mission statement to live life by. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-black">How someone lives now is what ends up determining what they leave behind in the future. For example, if you spent your life pouring into six million leaders the way Maxwell has intentionally done, others will say you enriched millions of lives because you did. </p> -->
