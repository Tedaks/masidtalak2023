            <h1 class="w3-center">HISTORY PNPA</h1>
            <p class="w3-text-black">The <b>Philippine National Police Academy or PNPA</b>, is a public safety school whose graduates are assigned as officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). PNPA was established on August 26, 1977, by the virtue of Section 19, PD 1184 and was tasked to provide tertiary level education to Filipinos aspiring to be officers in the three bureaus of the Department of the Interior and Local Government.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Pursuant to said Ministry Order, General Orders No. 23-P of Headquarters Philippine Constabulary / Integrated National Police dated June 23, 1978, formally announced the activation of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). The speed that characterized the creation and establishment of the new PNPA was a clear indication of the important role of the institution in the professional development of police officers in the country. In fact, its actual operations began even before its formal inauguration. It conducted entrance examinations for cadetship on May 28 and June 4, 1978, to select the best applicants for its first batch of cadets.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">When the formal inauguration took place on June 30, 1978, the cadets had to share quarters with the INP Training Command at Fort Bonifacio in Makati for more than two months before it moved to Camp Vicente Lim in Calamba, Laguna as its training venue on August 19, 1978. The apparent infancy of the academy presented such as lack of formal organization, staffing and a training site. This was, however, resolved by having the Integrated National Police Training Command Headquarters at Fort Bonifacio serve as surrogate organization of the academy</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Simultaneously with the formal establishment of the academy, the first batch of police cadets was chosen after a rigorous and painstaking selection process – including thorough medical and psychiatric examinations that took place on June 30, 1978. Formal academic instructions started on July 17, 1978, with 50 cadets, in formal ceremonies at Fort Bonifacio in the present Philippine Public Safety College grounds. Two years later, 45 of them finally graduated to compose the first Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) graduates – the Maharlika Class of 1980, commissioned Police Lieutenants.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">During its initial years of existence, the academy limited the admission of its student-cadets to the two-year Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) for qualified members of the Integrated National Police (INP) only. This meant that applicants outside the Integrated National Police (INP) services were not accepted in the cadetship program.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">When the Philippine National Police Academy was about to complete its third year of existence, the academy modified its admission requirements to include civilian applicants.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">On January 15, 1981, less than three years after its establishment, the academy was granted its Academic Charter through the promulgation of Presidential Decree 1780, otherwise known as “The Philippine National Police Academy Charter of 1981.” This decree elevated the academy to the status as the premier educational and training institution of the country's national police force.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Thus, the Philippine National Police Academy was specifically tasked “to develop and conduct comprehensive education and training programs with the view of Professionalizing the personnel in every level of command of the Integrated National Police.”</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">The 1978 Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) curriculum underwent curriculum and training revisions and modifications which brought about the transition from two years to a three-year curriculum, giving emphasis on the separate specialized areas for cadets who would opt for either the police, fire and jail services. In 1991, by virtue of the enactment of Republic Act 6975, otherwise known as the “Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990”, the INP became part of a new Philippine National Police, while its fire and jail branches were split, becoming both the Bureau of Fire Protection and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, respectively, all three falling under the Department of the Interior and Local Government. The PNPA remained the official joint officer training institution for the public security services of the republic. Finally, on April 13, 1994, the PNPA found its new and permanent home when it moved to Camp General Mariano N. Castañeda at Silang, Cavite.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">By virtue of the provisions of RA6975, The PNPA became a primary component of the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), the institution which was mandated as the premier institution for the training, human resource development and continuing education of all police, fire and jail personnel.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">It was in January 1997, under the leadership of Police Chief Superintendent Rufino G. Ibay, Jr. that the proposal to revise the Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) course into a four-year program was favorably endorsed by then Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President Guillermo P. Enriquez, Jr. that led to its eventual approval by the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) Board of Trustees which is composed of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary as chairman, the head of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) as members, and the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President as ex-officio member.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Since the academy moved to Camp General Mariano N Castañeda, Silang, Cavite in 1994 as its new and permanent home, its facilities have been continuously upgraded to make the academy conducive for learning.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Police, Jail and Fire Officer candidates attend a 4-year tertiary education course, allowing them to earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public Safety. Graduating cadets are then commissioned as Inspectors or as a Police Lieutenant, equivalent to a Military First Lieutenant or Lieutenant Junior Grade, in the tri-services of the DILG.</p>
