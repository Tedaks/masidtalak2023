            <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are taught to see struggle as a sign that something is going wrong. But what if it was instead a sign of impending success? Don’t fear struggle. Don’t avoid it at all costs. Struggling means that you have started to take action. It is harder than doing nothing, but it means that you are going forward with your goals. If there is nothing that needs to be overcome, perhaps it’s because nothing is happening? If you are waiting, there will be no struggle, but also no progress.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength comes from struggle. When you learn to see your struggles as opportunities to become stronger, better, wiser, then you’re thinking shifts from ‘I can’t do this’ to ‘I must do this.’ Struggle is a sign that you are trying, that you have set on a path to a goal.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second positive thing about struggle is that it teaches us a lot. When we make mistakes and solve problems, we learn as well. The person who falls down and gets up is better equipped to deal with any issue than someone who never started to run anyway. Obstacles make us wiser and better prepared to deal with a variety of situations. Things that come easy tend to be less appreciated.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might be faster and easier to get, sure, but they also have less emotional value. Think about it. If you are given a prize for no reason at all, it might feel nice. But will you truly value it? When we work for something, when we struggle, it feels truly ours. It feels earned. Struggle helps us appreciate what we gain. Struggle is our best teacher. It’s also what shows us whether the goals we are pursuing matter to us. When we struggle for the sake of something that really doesn’t matter, it will become evident when we face obstacles. Struggle is our friend, not our enemy. It shows us that we are making progress. It means that we are growing and pushing beyond our limits.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have to struggle, it means that we are truly giving it our all. Don’t give up if you face a struggle. Instead, ask yourself whether you are on the right path if you are not struggling at all. Is there truly something worthwhile? Is there something to challenge you? Embrace your struggle. It’s your teacher. Whatever the struggle, continue the climb. It may be only one step to the summit.</p>

              <h2 class="w3-center w3-text-black">THE LIVING LEGEND</h2>
              <p class="w3-text-black"><i>“The difference between the greats and the legends is their ability to focus for longer periods of time”.<b> – Jordan Burroughs</b></i></p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PMGEN Eric Escosio Noble is the current director of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). As a leader of this educational institution, he works hard and do his best to promote and maintain equality, justice, and peace. Also because of his intelligence and wealth of knowledge, he administers the academy well and above average. He has already made a lot of reforms throughout his term so far, especially with the cadet corps. His greatest responsibility was to make sure the cadets were protected, and his major goal was to put an end to all maltreatment that the cadets experience. What things he did to make him as a living legend? Do his deeds enough to makes him popular as a great officer serving with a purpose?</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 29, 1963, the director was born in the tranquil city of Cebu. He joined the police force in 1985. Afterward, he started his journey of selfless devotion to the Philippine National Police (PNP) institution. He displayed his exceptional leadership qualities throughout his tenure as an officer, giving his all to the country and its people, earning him the "Medalya ng Kagalingan" and "Medalya ng Kasanayan". Known for having a big heart for the community, the director took part in several outreach programs with the goal of helping the public and building ties with them. Because he was a genuine leader who cared about the community and had a purpose, he won a lot of respect and attention.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when he became the director of PNPA, through his own reforms, PMGEN Noble enhanced the cadets' educational and training programs. He delivered several lectures with the intention of strengthening and showing the cadets' cognitive and physical abilities. In order to educate the cadets for their future professions as law enforcement officials, he also fervently promoted the importance of valuing the cadets' discipline and ethical standards</p>
              <img src="./img/aswifepmgen.jpg" alt="CalculatorApp" style="width:100%">
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Director PMGEN Eric Noble showed the cadets his unwavering commitment to upholding human rights by educating them on abuse and hazing, two distressing issues that have and still do afflict the academy. He fostered the notion that some practices ought to be dropped and replaced, and in order to make this notion a reality, he crafted plans and policies that were squarely geared toward attaining it.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent example to follow, the director is certainly more than just a leader or an officer. to strive to be as an example. He is also the best supporter, continuously pushing the cadets to develop their skills, talents, and abilities. He consistently encouraged the cadets to participate in activities that enhanced their mutual understanding and allowed them to take advantage of their strengths in a variety of endeavors. He vehemently opposes bullying and hazing. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the cadets and made it clear that any form of hazing or harassment will not be tolerated. Cadets have been instructed by PMGEN Noble to report any hazing occurrences, and he has established a  trustworthy process for examining and managing such cases.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the cadets, academy, and our country have all benefited greatly from everything PNPA director PMAJ Eric Escosio Noble has accomplished. Having an officer like him in the academy is a gift. He is an inspirational leader who leads by setting a good example. His accomplishments will be remembered not just now, but also for the foreseeable future of this institution. His name will be always known for living as a legend pursuing advocacy for the betterment of the cadets and showing exceptional abilities as a true leader of this country.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">HISTORY PNPA</h1>
            <p class="w3-text-black">The <b>Philippine National Police Academy or PNPA</b>, is a public safety school whose graduates are assigned as officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). PNPA was established on August 26, 1977, by the virtue of Section 19, PD 1184 and was tasked to provide tertiary level education to Filipinos aspiring to be officers in the three bureaus of the Department of the Interior and Local Government.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Pursuant to said Ministry Order, General Orders No. 23-P of Headquarters Philippine Constabulary / Integrated National Police dated June 23, 1978, formally announced the activation of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). The speed that characterized the creation and establishment of the new PNPA was a clear indication of the important role of the institution in the professional development of police officers in the country. In fact, its actual operations began even before its formal inauguration. It conducted entrance examinations for cadetship on May 28 and June 4, 1978, to select the best applicants for its first batch of cadets.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">When the formal inauguration took place on June 30, 1978, the cadets had to share quarters with the INP Training Command at Fort Bonifacio in Makati for more than two months before it moved to Camp Vicente Lim in Calamba, Laguna as its training venue on August 19, 1978. The apparent infancy of the academy presented such as lack of formal organization, staffing and a training site. This was, however, resolved by having the Integrated National Police Training Command Headquarters at Fort Bonifacio serve as surrogate organization of the academy</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Simultaneously with the formal establishment of the academy, the first batch of police cadets was chosen after a rigorous and painstaking selection process – including thorough medical and psychiatric examinations that took place on June 30, 1978. Formal academic instructions started on July 17, 1978, with 50 cadets, in formal ceremonies at Fort Bonifacio in the present Philippine Public Safety College grounds. Two years later, 45 of them finally graduated to compose the first Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) graduates – the Maharlika Class of 1980, commissioned Police Lieutenants.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">During its initial years of existence, the academy limited the admission of its student-cadets to the two-year Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) for qualified members of the Integrated National Police (INP) only. This meant that applicants outside the Integrated National Police (INP) services were not accepted in the cadetship program.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">When the Philippine National Police Academy was about to complete its third year of existence, the academy modified its admission requirements to include civilian applicants.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">On January 15, 1981, less than three years after its establishment, the academy was granted its Academic Charter through the promulgation of Presidential Decree 1780, otherwise known as “The Philippine National Police Academy Charter of 1981.” This decree elevated the academy to the status as the premier educational and training institution of the country's national police force.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Thus, the Philippine National Police Academy was specifically tasked “to develop and conduct comprehensive education and training programs with the view of Professionalizing the personnel in every level of command of the Integrated National Police.”</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">The 1978 Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) curriculum underwent curriculum and training revisions and modifications which brought about the transition from two years to a three-year curriculum, giving emphasis on the separate specialized areas for cadets who would opt for either the police, fire and jail services. In 1991, by virtue of the enactment of Republic Act 6975, otherwise known as the “Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990”, the INP became part of a new Philippine National Police, while its fire and jail branches were split, becoming both the Bureau of Fire Protection and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, respectively, all three falling under the Department of the Interior and Local Government. The PNPA remained the official joint officer training institution for the public security services of the republic. Finally, on April 13, 1994, the PNPA found its new and permanent home when it moved to Camp General Mariano N. Castañeda at Silang, Cavite.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">By virtue of the provisions of RA6975, The PNPA became a primary component of the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), the institution which was mandated as the premier institution for the training, human resource development and continuing education of all police, fire and jail personnel.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">It was in January 1997, under the leadership of Police Chief Superintendent Rufino G. Ibay, Jr. that the proposal to revise the Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) course into a four-year program was favorably endorsed by then Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President Guillermo P. Enriquez, Jr. that led to its eventual approval by the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) Board of Trustees which is composed of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary as chairman, the head of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) as members, and the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President as ex-officio member.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Since the academy moved to Camp General Mariano N Castañeda, Silang, Cavite in 1994 as its new and permanent home, its facilities have been continuously upgraded to make the academy conducive for learning.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-black">Police, Jail and Fire Officer candidates attend a 4-year tertiary education course, allowing them to earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public Safety. Graduating cadets are then commissioned as Inspectors or as a Police Lieutenant, equivalent to a Military First Lieutenant or Lieutenant Junior Grade, in the tri-services of the DILG.</p>
