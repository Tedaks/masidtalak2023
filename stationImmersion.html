                of allowing them to meet one another and to learn about and discuss issues, ideas and work that
                focus on a topic of mutual concern. The Latin roots of the word “conference” mean, literally,
                “Bring together.” A conference brings together people and ideas. In the cases of health and
                community work, conferences often have the goal of generating or working toward solutions to
                problems or broader social change.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">In order for us to be ready and have plans for the future events, conferences are crucial for us as future law enforcement personnel. Through conferences, we will be able to gather information, opinions, and advice from others, which is also a good way to create connections that lead to positive relationships. In order to prepare for an immediate solution, current and anticipated issues were also discussed. </p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">[1 Crowd control is a public security practice in which large crowds are managed in order to prevent the outbreak of crowd crushes, affray, fights involving drunk and disorderly people or riots. Crowd crushes in particular can cause many hundreds of fatalities.[1] Effective crowd management is about managing expected and unexpected crowd occurrences.[2] Crowd control can involve privately hired security guards as well as police officers. Crowd control is often used at large, public gatherings like street fairs, music festivals, stadiums and public demonstrations. At some events, security guards and police use metal detectors and sniffer dogs to prevent weapons and drugs being brought into a venue.] </p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Crowd control is the process of keeping the peace and limiting the number of people in a particular area during an event. In order to assist the citizens with the greatest amount of patience and tolerance, this type of work involved the cadets in a field that demands effective communication skills. Unquestionably, all of the skills needed for this activity will be applicable and useful to the cadets' future work as public safety officers. </p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">[1]Closed circuit television (CCTV) programs use surveillance cameras in public and private areas in an attempt to prevent property and personal crime. Not all CCTV systems are policemonitored, but some are (e.g. see Caplan et al. 2011 in Newark). CCTV is designed to increase formal surveillance by making it easier for the police (or other agencies) to monitor the behavior of citizens (including potential offenders). CCTV is intended to deter crime by increasing the risk of detection for criminal behavior. CCTV footage can also be used to identify suspects in offenses that are committed within view of the camera (see more on CCTV from Piza, 2018).</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">Working in a technologically advanced world requires us to stay current and be prepared to use these tools effectively when conducting law enforcement. We should be able to use these tools, specifically CCTVs, as a tool to monitor and uphold peace and order in your community as a future officer. </p>

              <p class="w3-text-black">When both entities are working together toward the same goal, everyone benefits. Police depend on the community to report crimes, cooperate as witnesses, and even look out for themselves and other officers. Police work runs much more smoothly with the trust and cooperation of the community. This results in lower crime rates, more effective police investigations, and an overall safer community.</p>

Participating in such an advocacy now as a potential leader will help you hone the serving and communication skills you'll likely need in the workplace later on. Your abilities to connect with the public will improve as a result of participating in this kind of activity. Participating in activities like BIDA will, more importantly, help close the gap between the community and the police, fostering good relationships that will pave the way for future collaboration. In the event that this takes place, it will be extremely beneficial in reducing crime and other issues in our nation. </p>

This program was originally made by our Regional Director PBGEN Jerry F Bearis to engage the community especially those drug advocates in this program because he believe that thru drills and ceremonies and other militaristic approaches would instill the utmost discipline of the people. Also in addition other sections of the office like the PNP health service provided medical and dental support to the advocates to let them know that we care for them. This program also is in connection with the KASIMBAYAN program of our CPNP which relates to what our PNPA Director always said to us that to win the heart of the community is thru a strong Police Community Relations because at the end of the day, how can we get the cooperation of the public against crime prevention and detection if we the Law enforcers were not able to show the community the trust that they expected from us.

                One of the fundamental keys to successful law enforcement is good police-community relations, or the relationship between the police and the communities they serve. Good police-community relations are imperative for developing trust between police and citizens. Without this trust, police work becomes much less effective. .Even if the police officers are preventing crime, the people may not feel safe because there is no trust. Other times, officers are fighting an uphill battle trying to get communities to work with them to fight crime.

            <div class="w3-container">
              <p class="w3-text-black">I learned about the roles of patrol operations, investigative operations, and special operations in police work while taking a tour and learning about the operational branch's office. In fact, I'll be able to use this when I eventually start working in law enforcement. The operational branch also has a broad range of responsibilities; I learned that keeping the town safe and orderly requires a lot of patrols, inspection, and investigation.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">[1] Police operations encompass all duties and practices implemented in law enforcement by police. Identify the development and functions of patrol operations, investigation operations, and special operations in police work. Understanding what it means to be an officer means understanding the complete set of responsibilities, duties and practices of police work, which we can just call police operations. Police work contains a great number of duties and responsibilities.  
                The first category is patrol policing, which is the enforcement of law by officers directly working in and moving around a community. When you think of a police officer, this is probably who you're picturing. Police patrols have changed a lot since they were first really established in the 19th century, but their duties can be summarized in four ways. 
                First is crime prevention, stopping crime before it occurs. This can happen through various acts of deterrence, the most basic simply being maintaining a police presence. Having police patrolling neighborhoods reduces the opportunities for crime to occur and deters criminals. 
                Patrol officers are also in charge of law enforcement, or stopping people who are breaking laws. 
                This is why officers have the legal authority to arrest and detain. 
                Now, patrol officers deter crime and apprehend suspects for committing a crime, but many crimes are committed when no one is around to see it happen. That's why another major operational duty of police is investigation of crime scenes and criminals. Basically, this means identifying a crime scene, recovering clues, and locating a perpetrator. This requires a different set of skills, including forensic analysis and creating psychological profiles of potential suspects. Police involved in investigative work often deal very closely with prosecutors to ensure that all of the evidence needed to secure a conviction is found and properly handled. 
                That is why as a future law enforcement officer it is very important to have knowledge on how operations section works because it has a huge contribution on the flow of law enforcement in a community.

Further, it will bring forth a more comprehensive policy that adapts to a fast-changing environment amid technological shifts and socio-cultural transformation in an information society, as well as intensifies police-community partnerships as the key to ensuring security, public order and safety. 
                The Philippine National Police as an organization is a part of the community it serves. For the police, Community represent a source of both support and complaints and most importantly, Community is the final measure of the quality of Police service and the effectiveness of the Police department. The concept of community relations, is not simple matter of dialogue and agreement on some issues. Instead, it consists of a carefully structured program involving both community and criminal justice system participation. There is a need for good community relations, but the responsibility for its success cannot rest solely upon the police or any other single agency of criminal justice system. 
                That’s why as law enforcer we should be well equipped in terms of knowledge and skills to interact with the community because as we all see nowadays PCR surrounds all aspect of police work.

              <p class="w3-text-black">Knowing your obligations and responsibilities as a police officer includes understanding the value of police visibility. I discovered that if the community has issues that need to be addressed, we, the police, should be readily accessible to them. By doing this, we will also gain the public's trust, which will help build a better community with lower crime rates, an environment free of disorder, and problems.</p>
              <p class="w3-text-black">[1]The police visibility in the community is a successful policing of the PNP officials working cooperatively to identify and deal with crime and quality of life within the neighborhood. Police responding to citizen’s concerns relating to crime and public safety, implementing crime prevention initiatives, and maintaining the quality of life was the a mission of the Philippine National Police.  
                Thus, effective policing on police visibility within the community is essential to the police relationships to the community. Increasing the law enforcer’s effectiveness in enforcing the law, reducing crime and maintaining peace is a vital sign of peace and order with the community. It can further strengthened initiating programs to make the community feel safe with the police. When every citizen feels safe in the community, trust and confidence in the police is regained. Thus, it will be easier to solicit their support in all police programs to attain genuine peace and security. In so doing, the Philippine National Police shall be a more accessible and indispensable partner of the community in more efficient and effective services. 
                According to RA 8551, “The Philippine National Police shall be a community and service– oriented agency for the maintenance of peace and order and public safety. The PNP shall be so organized to ensure accountability and uprightness in police exercise of discretion as well as to achieve efficiency and effectiveness of its me mbers and units in the performance of their functions”.
