                    <p class="mb-4 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Kenneth Banogon Gako</b>, was born on June 7, 1998, in the town of Sibonga, Cebu. He is the youngest of two siblings. Both his parents are very humble, supportive and loving. His father, Franklin Gako, a former Philippine Constabulary turned into PNP, was 30 years in service and came from Tomonoy, Moalboal; while his mother, Estrellita Gako, a Nursing Aide graduate, became a business woman and came from Bahay, Sibonga. Both his parents currently own a simple business in Sibonga.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a young age, he was greatly influenced by his father to become a public safety officer and that influence became his passion. This passion has driven him to a great path. The Philippine National Police Academy conducts a Cadet Admission Test annually.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 18, he took his first PNPACAT but failed the physical exam. As he was overweight and couldn’t perform the proper physical tasks. From that experience, his desire became stronger and deliberately changed his lifestyle.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 pb-5" style="font-size: 25px;">
                    <p class="mb-5 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 19, he took the PNPACAT for the second time but circumstances didn’t allow him to succeed, many things hindered his attempt to process his admission. However, his desire didn’t fade. It stayed and that kept him going.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at 20, he successfully earned his bachelor’s degree in Criminology, took his third PNPACAT and was successful. The third attempt must have been his last chance but he grabbed and took that chance firmly.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5 w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, he is a cadet first class in PNPA MASIDTALAK CLASS OF 2023. Soon, he will officially carry the title of “Police Lieutenant” and is now ready to evince his competence and credibility. His journey is a great example of the saying “Tough times never last, but tough people do”.</p>

                    <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-black">Stages of Cadetship</h1>
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in leadership is to exercise influence. A leader pulls his followers into action, not by force, but by captivating their hearts to accomplish the visions set by the leader. There are two types of submission: obedience motivated by fear and obedience motivated by respect- and they are very different. Do they submit to you because of your position or because of who you are?</p>
                    <img src="./img/gaks (4).JPG" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-center w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my plebe days until now, the phrase "follow and follow until you follow no more" has been my greatest reminder, that to be a leader, I must first be a follower and a follower is as important as the leader.</p>
                    <img src="./img/gaks (5).JPG" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a plebe in my first year, I thought of myself as a leader, not because I think highly of myself but rather due of my ability to lead myself, not only others. There were shouts everywhere, ten counts and a lot of things happening simultaneously, but I stayed calm despite the pressure by managing myself. Since then, I made a pledge to myself that I would give advice and guidance to my subordinates as they go through this tough but rewarding cadetship journey.</p>
                    <img src="./img/gaks (1).JPEG" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I'm a third-class cadet entering my second year, and during this time I have fully comprehended that leading others could eventually become increasingly demanding. As I thrive vigorously, I was also leading the susceptible fourth graders and not compromising anything while imparting discipline and teaching them the fundamentals.</p>
                    <img src="./img/gaks (2).JPG" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another chapter, here, I'm a second-class cadet in my third year. I accepted the challenge and rose to the position as a squad leader of a group consisting, three first year and three second year cadets. I never touched them; instead, I treated them as if they were my little brothers. I became a teacher, a mentor, and role model for my squad mates while being a strict disciplinarian. We all share the same objective and that is, to be able to graduate by our God’s grace!</p>
                    <img src="./img/1CGAKO.png" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am finally a first-class cadet in my fourth year, Amen! I am appointed as the First Sergeant of the Bravo Company. Now, I can clearly see the importance of accountability, privilege, and power. Assuming accountability for my men's behaviour and using my authority in a morally and sound manner. No one suffered abuse or turned into an advocate for hazing.</p>
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did we attend the academy to conform or to change? Real leadership is being able to acknowledge the negative while still pursuing the positive. Always put in mind that a leader’s success is not measured by what he has accomplished but rather by what others have accomplished under his guidance and supervision.</p>
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understood that as you rise, your standards must follow. Our capacity determines our leadership; so, do we possess the capacity of a lieutenant? According to the Law of the Lid; a person's level of effectiveness is determined by their leadership capacity. The lower an individual’s ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential. The higher the individual’s ability to lead, the higher the lid on his potential (Maxwell, J. 2013).</p>
                    <img src="./img/asgaks2.jpg" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experiences when it comes to leadership has been enlightening; I've learned the value of having the right heart, intellect, and abilities. That no matter how talented you are, your character is what really counts. Be a man of endurance, humility, courage, and faith, just like King David. Be a role model and have an outlook for the future.</p>
                    <img src="./img/asgaks3.jpg" class="centerpic">
                    <p class="w3-text-black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here and now, at this nesting area. From a sheep to a shepherd, I studied to develop my capacity and capability, just like our respected director reminded us, "To Learn Today, To Lead Today." I acquired the skill of honouring God with my time, skills, and wealth. God has blessed me beyond my wildest dreams, and I am what I am today because of His Grace and Mercy. Am I truly ready to take the initiative at this point? All along, this has been my dream and only I can turn my dream into a reality. A great reminder by George Bill; leadership is a journey, not a destination. It is a marathon, not a sprint. It is a process, not an outcome.</p>
